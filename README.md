# Baggage Share - Save on Extra Baggage Charges

## Overview
**Baggage Share** is a non-profit, open-source platform designed to help travelers save money on extra baggage fees. The application allows users to interact with others who have available space in their luggage, enabling them to share baggage space and split the cost of extra weight. By connecting people who need additional space with those who have room, we aim to make travel more affordable and environmentally friendly.

This project is community-driven and open for contributions from developers and travelers alike!
